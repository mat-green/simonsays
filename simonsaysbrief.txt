Simonsays Brief
================================================================================

Create a simonsays memory game made up of four squares (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue) that uses the `src/assets/data.json` file to determine sequences to play. The game should play each sequence to player. Giving the player a chance to re-enter the sequence. When the player fails all four squares should flash and replay the sequence.

The number of sequences given in the data file can be any.

Please provide unit and user acceptance tests.
